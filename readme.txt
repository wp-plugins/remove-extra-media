Use Remove Extra Media by Aihrus to remove extra media attachments from your selected post types.

== Description ==

Use Remove Extra Media [by Aihrus](http://aihr.us/about-aihrus/) to remove extra media attachments from your selected post types.

In my use case, my testimonials widgets post types in some cases, for whatever reason, had up to 7 extra media attachments related to them. I wanted a quick way to clear those excess out. Considering that the only image or media attachment a testimonial should have was the featured, I simply removed all the others.

This tool works by removing the attachment relationship as this saves the media file in case it's used by other attachments. Using `wp_delete_attachment` would delete the media file, which is something to avoid.
