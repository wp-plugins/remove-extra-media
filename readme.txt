Use this tool to remove extra media attachments from your selected post types.

== Description ==

Use this tool to remove extra media attachments from your selected post types.

In my use case, my testimonials widgets post types in some cases, for whatever reason, had up to 7 extra media attachments related to them. I wanted a quick way to clear those excess out. Considering that the only image or media attachment a testimonial should have was the featured, I simply removed all the others.

This tool works by removing the attachment relationship as this saves the media file in case it's used by other attachments. Using `wp_delete_attachment` would delete the media file, which is something to avoid.

== Beta Testers Needed ==

I really want Remove Extra Media and Remove Extra Media Premium to be the best WordPress plugins of their type. However, it's beyond me to do it alone.

I need beta testers to help with ensuring pending releases of Remove Extra Media and Remove Extra Media Premium are solid. This would benefit us all by helping reduce the number of releases and raise code quality.

[Please contact me directly](http://aihr.us/contact-aihrus/).

Beta testers benefit directly with latest versions, a free 1-site license for Remove Extra Media Premium, and personalized support assistance.
